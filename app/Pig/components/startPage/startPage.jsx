                <p>On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible,
                    adding up the numbers rolled on the die. However, if a player rolls a 1, the player&#39;s turn is
                    over
                    and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a 1 doesn&#39;t wipe
                    out
                    your entire score from previous turns, just the total earned during that particular roll.</p>

                <p>A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling the die) if they do not want to take a chance of
                    rolling
                    a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points
                    rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.</p>

                <p>When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.</p>
